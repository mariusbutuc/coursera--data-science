> One of the major components of a data scientist's job is to collect and clean data. Whether at a small organization or a major enterprise, the first step in using data is getting, cleaning and understanding the data. In this course we will focus on R packages and a few outside tools that can be used to collect data from a variety of sources, from Excel files to databases like MySQL. We will also cover a variety of formats including JSON, XML, and flat files (.csv, .txt).
>
> The emphasis of this course is on creating tidy data sets that can be used in downstream analyses. Once you have mastered the material in this course you will be ready to learn about the techniques for exploring, analyzing, and summarizing data offered through our courses track or other Statistics, Data Science, or Machine Learning MOOCs.
