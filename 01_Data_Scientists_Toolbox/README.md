# [The Data Scientist's Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/course/datascitoolbox)

> This course can serve as your first step on your path to working in the field.
>
> In this course you will get an introduction to the main tools and ideas in the data scientist's toolbox. The course gives an overview of the _data_, _questions_, and _tools_ that data analysts and data scientists work with.
>
> There are two components to this course:
>   1. The first is a _conceptual_ introduction to the ideas behind turning data into actionable knowledge.
>   2. The second is a _practical_ introduction to the tools that will be used in the program like version control, markdown, git, Github, R, and Rstudio.
