## Data Science

Notes along a journey of structured learning about [Data Science][ds].

### Goal

> Our course track is focused on providing you with three things:
>
> 1. an introduction to the **key ideas** behind working with data in a scientific way that will produce new and reproducible insight,
> 2. an introduction to the **tools** that will allow you to execute on a data analytic strategy, from raw data in a database to a completed report with interactive graphics, and
> 3. on giving you plenty of **hands on practice** so you can learn the techniques for yourself.
