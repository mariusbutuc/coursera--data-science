# [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata)

> Before you can work with data you have to get some.

> This course will cover the basic ways that data can be obtained. The course will cover _obtaining data_ from the web, from APIs, and from colleagues in various formats. It will also cover the basics of _data cleaning_ and how to make data “tidy”. Tidy data dramatically speed downstream data analysis tasks. The course will also cover the components of a complete data set including
>   * raw data,
>   * processing instructions,
>   * codebooks, and
>   * processed data.

> The course will cover the basics needed for collecting, cleaning, and sharing data.
